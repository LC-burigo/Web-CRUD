# Web-CRUD

### In this small and simple project, the crud system is shown to manipulate a list of schools and their students. I didnÂ´t create a CRUD system for the students, so just the admin can do that.

***The meaning of CRUD***
> C- create a new school \
> R- read the schools from a database, in a list. \
> U- upgrate an existing school \
> D- delete an existing school


***Functionalities***
1. Base Page

   <img src="projeto/school_1.png"  width=600>
   
2. Create view

By adding to the url: app_projeto\create, a new page will open to create a new school, with a form to fill

   <img src="projeto/school_2.png"  width=600>
   
3. Detail view
 
When you submit your completed form, automatically you will go to the detail view page

4. Update view

By clicking in [update](#) buttom, a new page will open to update this new school, with a form to fill and modify those infomations

6. Delete view

By writing 127.0.0.1.8000/app_projeto/delete/{pk} you can delete the school corresponding to that primary key
