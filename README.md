# Web-CRUD

###In this small and simple project, the crud system is shown to manipulate a list of schools and their students. I didnÂ´t create a CRUD system for the students, so just the admin can do that.

***The meaning of CRUD***
> C- create a new school \
> R- read the schools from a database, in a list. \
> U- upgrate an existing school \
> D- delete an existing school


***Functionalities***
